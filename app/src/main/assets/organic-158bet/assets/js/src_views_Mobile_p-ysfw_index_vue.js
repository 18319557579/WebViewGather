PURCHASES OF VIRTUAL CHIPS We have entered into an agreement with Rational Social to provide and operate the Virtual Chips for use in the Service. When purchasing Virtual Chips for use in the Service you are contracting directly with Rational Social. 1A.1. While using the Service, you may &quot;earn&quot;, &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;purchase&quot; Virtual Chips for use in the Service. You hereby acknowledge that these “real world” terms are only used figuratively, and you agree that you have no right or title in Virtual Chips appearing or originating in any Game, whether &quot;earned&quot; in a Game or &quot;purchased&quot; from Rational Social, or any other attributes associated within an account or stored on the Service. Any &quot;virtual currency&quot; balance shown in your Stars Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license. 1A.2. Rational Social prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of Virtual Chips effectuated outside of the Service, or the purported sale, gift or trade in the &quot;real world&quot; of anything that appears or originates in the Service, unless otherwise expressly authorized by Rational Social in writing. Accordingly you may not sublicence, trade, sell, or attempt to sell Virtual Chips for value of any kind outside of a Game. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void and may subject your Stars Account to termination. In addition, you acknowledge that we may commence legal action against you for any harm done by such transfer or attempted transfer of Virtual Chips outside of the Service. 1A.3. You may purchase a license to use Virtual Chips for valuable consideration, by visiting the purchase page on the Service, providing your billing information, confirming the particulars of your purchase and re-affirming your agreement to this Agreement. 1A.4. When you purchase a license to use Virtual Chips, we may send you a confirmatory e-mail that will contain details of the Virtual Chips you have ordered. Please check that the details in the confirmatory e-mail are correct as soon as possible and maintain a copy of it for your records. If you have any concern, please contact customer support. Rational Social keeps records of transactions in order to deal with any queries. 1A.5. For the purchase of Virtual Chips, your order will represent an offer to us to purchase a license for such Virtual Chips which will be accepted by us when we make the Virtual Chips available in your account for you to use in our Games (the &quot;Acceptance&quot;). Your license to use Virtual Chips for use in our Games is a service provided by Rational Social that commences upon Acceptance by Rational Social of your purchase. A purchase of a license to use Virtual Chips is non-refundable by Rational Social. 1A.6. Rational Social may revise the pricing for the Service and the Virtual Chips it licenses to you through the Service at any time. You acknowledge that Rational Social is not required to provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Chips when a Stars Account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or involuntary. 1A.7. For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby clarified that the purchase of a license to use Virtual Chips does not entitle you to any rights whatsoever other than those reflected by the license. It is furthermore clarified that a license purchased may only be transferred as explicitly provided for within the terms of the license and that such license may not be redeemed, sold, transferred, bequeathed, leased, rented or otherwise disposed of in return for valuable consideration. 2.

AUTHORITY 3.1 We retain authority over the issuing, maintenance, and closing of Users&#39; accounts on the Sites. The decision of our management, as regards any aspect of a User&#39;s account, use of the Service or dispute resolution, is final and shall not be open to review or appeal. 4. YOUR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Prior to your use of the Service and on an ongoing basis you represent, warrant, covenant and agree that: 4.1 your use of the Service is at your sole option, discretion and risk. 4.2 you will need to provide us with certain personal details about yourself (including details regarding your methods of payment for the purposes of acquiring Virtual Chips) as well as (for the purposes of using the Service via the Mobile Software) consenting to our use of location-based services (LBS) to detect your geographic location, for the purpose of using the Service. We will process your personal details in compliance with the data protection laws and regulations of the Isle of Man all in accordance with and as set out in our Privacy Policy. 4.3 the telecommunications networks and Internet access services required for you to access and use the Service are entirely beyond our control and we shall have no liability whatsoever for any outages, slowness, capacity constraints or other deficiencies affecting the same. 4.4 you are solely responsible for any applicable taxes which may be payable on cash or prizes awarded to you through your using the Services. 4.5 you are prohibited from using the Service in any way to create, receive or facilitate the transfer or receipt of any financial gain or other pecuniary advantage to you or any third party (whether or not acting on your behalf). Chips have no value in and of themselves and are not transferable and exchangeable within a Stars Account except in accordance with our transfer policy. Further, such Virtual Chips have no value in themselves and are not redeemable for any &#39;real&#39; currency or prize. Thus you are prohibited from sublicensing, renting, leasing, selling, trading, gifting, bequeathing or otherwise transferring your Stars Account or any Chips associated with your Stars Account to a third person. 4.6 you are aged 18 or over and that you are not currently self-excluded from any online or mobile gambling site and that you will inform us immediately if you enter into a self-exclusion agreement with any gambling provider; 4.7 you have provided true and accurate information concerning your physical address and identity, including nationality; 4.8 you are not currently on any list of persons that would prohibit the Group from engaging in business or other dealings, or otherwise offering the Service to you; 4.9 you are not prohibited due to your geographic location or otherwise from receiving funds from the Group; and 4.10 if you are identified as such a person as detailed in Clause 4.8 or 4.9, the Group may immediately terminate your account and all access to any of the Services. 5. PROHIBITED USES 5.1 SOFTWARE MODIFICATIONS. User may not attempt to modify, decompile, reverse-engineer or disassemble the Software in any way. 5.2 PERSONAL USE. The Service is intended solely for the User&#39;s personal use and entertainment and not for money and must not in any way be used to create any financial gain or other pecuniary advantage to you. The User must provide full and truthful information in respect of all details and information provided by the User to us, and the User is obligated to update such details in the event of any change thereto. 5.3 COLLUSION. Collusion between Users by sharing hole cards or by any other methods is strictly forbidden. We reserve the right, in addition to other measures, to restrict seating and/or to prohibit Users from playing at a particular poker table or in a tournament, including restricting two or more Users from playing together at the same table or in the same tournament. In addition, we reserve the right to consider any collusion between players (including Users) as a material breach of this Agreement and accordingly we shall have the right to terminate a User&#39;s account if a User engages or attempts to engage in any such activity, regardless of the outcome of such attempt. 5.4 EXTERNAL PLAYER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TOOLS. We prohibit external player assistance tools (&quot;EPA Tools&quot;) that are designed to provide an &quot;unfair advantage&quot; to players. We define &quot;EPA Tools&quot; as computer software (other than the Software), and non-software-based systems (e.g. web sites, subscription services and physical materials). We take a broad view of what constitutes &quot;unfair advantage&quot; in the context of any use of EPA Tools and specific guidance can be found in our Third Party Tools and Services FAQ. For the avoidance of doubt, what is prohibited encompasses but is not limited to accessing or compiling information on other players beyond that which the User has personally observed through the User&#39;s own game play or receiving advice, direction or assistance on how to play, in real time, that goes beyond a basic level. 5.5 AUTOMATIC PLAYERS (BOTS). The use of artificial intelligence including, without limitation, &quot;robots&quot; is strictly forbidden in connection with the Service. All actions taken in relation to the Service by a User must be executed personally by players through the user interface accessible by use of the Software, and without the assistance of any form of artificial intelligence. 5.6 You agree that we may take steps to detect and prevent the use of prohibited EPA Tools. These steps may include, but are not limited to, examination of software programs running concurrently with our Software on the User&#39;s PC or Device. You agree that you will not attempt to bypass, interfere with, or block such steps, including, without limitation, the use of third party software that bypasses, interferes with, or blocks such steps. 5.7 CHIP-DUMPING. Chip-dumping occurs when any User intentionally loses a hand in order to deliberately transfer his Chips to another User. Any User who participates or attempts to participate in chip-dumping with any other User while using the Service may be permanently banned from using the Service and their Stars Account may be terminated immediately. In such circumstances we will be under no obligation to return or credit to you any Chips that may be in your Stars Account at such time. 5.8 FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR. In the event that we deem that a User has engaged or attempted to engage in fraudulent, unlawful, dishonest or improper activity while using the Service, including without limitation, engaging in any of the activities set forth above or any other game manipulation, we shall be entitled to take such action as we see fit, including but not limited to: immediately blocking a User&#39;s access to the Service, seizing all Chips held in the User&#39;s account, terminating a User&#39;s account; and/or taking legal action against a User. 6. OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE OR CONTENT The User is prohibited from posting any unlawful, indecent, racist, obscene, libelous, defamatory or threatening material or any material that would violate any law or generally be considered to be offensive, via the Service whether using the chat function, the player images option or in correspondence with our staff. 7. BREACH 7.1 Without prejudice to any other rights, if a User breaches in whole or in part any provision contained herein, 688bet./Full Tilt or any other company within the Group which provides services to the User reserves the right to take such action as it sees fit, including terminating this Agreement or any other agreement in place with the User, including immediately blocking the User&#39;s access to the Service or to any other service offered by the Group, terminating such User&#39;s account on the Sites or on any other site operated by the Group and/or taking legal action against such User. 7.2 You agree to fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless 688bet./Full Tilt, the Group and its shareholders, directors and employees from and against all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses, including legal fees and any other charges whatsoever, howsoever caused, that may arise as a result of: 7.2.1. your breach of this Agreement, in whole or in part; 7.2.2. violation by you of any law or any third party rights; and 7.2.3. use by you of the Service or use by any other person accessing the Service using your Login Credentials (as defined below), whether or not with your authorization. 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 8.1 Under no circumstances, including negligence, shall any member of the Group be liable for any special, incidental, direct, indirect or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use (or misuse) of the Service even if we had prior knowledge of the possibility of such damages. 8.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit 688bet./Full Tilt or the Group&#39;s liability for: (a) death or personal injury resulting from its negligence; or (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. 9. SECURITY AND YOUR ACCOUNT 9.1 Each Stars Account shall be accessible through the use of a combination of a unique username (&quot;Username&quot;), a unique and secret password (&quot;Password&quot;), and other optional numeric authentication methods that the User may select (the Username, Password and any other authentication features together being referred to as the &quot;Login Credentials&quot;).
